# Skyrim Community Shaders

SKSE core plugin for community-driven advanced graphics modifications.

[Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86492)

## Requirements

-   Any terminal of your choice (e.g., PowerShell)
-   [Visual Studio Community 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
    -   Desktop development with C++
-   [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
    -   Edit the `PATH` environment variable and add the cmake.exe install path as a new value
    -   Instructions for finding and editing the `PATH` environment variable can be found [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html)
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    -   Edit the `PATH` environment variable and add the Git.exe install path as a new value
-   [Vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)
    -   Install vcpkg using the directions in vcpkg's [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#quick-start-windows)
    -   After install, add a new environment variable named `VCPKG_ROOT` with the value as the path to the folder containing vcpkg
    -   Make sure your local vcpkg repo matches the commit id specified in `builtin-baseline` in `vcpkg.json` otherwise you might get another version of a non pinned vcpkg dependency causing undefined behaviour

## User Requirements

-   [Address Library for SKSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444)
    -   Needed for SSE/AE
-   [VR Address Library for SKSEVR](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58101)
    -   Needed for VR

## Register Visual Studio as a Generator

-   Open `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt`
-   Run `cmake`
-   Close the cmd window

Or, in powershell run:

```pwsh
& "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" amd64
```

## Clone and Build

Open terminal (e.g., PowerShell) and run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/doodlum/skyrim-community-shaders.git --recursive
cd skyrim-community-shaders
.\BuildRelease.bat
```

### CMAKE Options (optional)

If you want an example CMakeUserPreset to start off with you can copy the `CMakeUserPresets.json.template` -> `CMakeUserPresets.json`

#### AUTO_PLUGIN_DEPLOYMENT

-   This option is default `"OFF"`
-   Make sure `"AUTO_PLUGIN_DEPLOYMENT"` is set to `"ON"` in `CMakeUserPresets.json`
-   Change the `"CommunityShadersOutputDir"` value to match your desired outputs, if you want multiple folders you can separate them by `;` is shown in the template example

#### AIO_ZIP_TO_DIST

-   This option is default `"ON"`
-   Make sure `"AIO_ZIP_TO_DIST"` is set to `"ON"` in `CMakeUserPresets.json`
-   This will create a `CommunityShaders_AIO.7z` archive in /dist containing all features and base mod

#### ZIP_TO_DIST

-   This option is default `"ON"`
-   Make sure `"ZIP_TO_DIST"` is set to `"ON"` in `CMakeUserPresets.json`
-   This will create a zip for each feature and one for the base Community shaders in /dist
-   If having a file with name `CORE` in the root of the features folder it will instead be merged into the core zip

#### TRACY_SUPPORT

-   This option is default `"OFF"`
-   This will enable tracy support, might need to delete build folder when this option is changed

When using custom preset you can call BuildRelease.bat with an parameter to specify which preset to configure eg:
`.\BuildRelease.bat ALL-WITH-AUTO-DEPLOYMENT`

When switching between different presets you might need to remove the build folder

### Build with Docker

For those who prefer to not install Visual Studio or other build dependencies on their machine, this encapsulates it. This uses Windows Containers, so no WSL for now.

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) first if not already there.
2. In a shell of your choice run to switch to Windows containers and create the build container:

```pwsh
& 'C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\DockerCli.exe' -SwitchWindowsEngine; `
docker build -t skyrim-community-shaders .
```

3. Then run the build:

```pwsh
docker run -it --rm -v .:C:/skyrim-community-shaders skyrim-community-shaders:latest
```

4. Retrieve the generated build files from the `build/aio` folder.
5. In subsequent builds only run the build step (3.)

#### Troubleshooting Build with Docker

If you run into `Access violation` build errors during step 3, you can try adding [`--isolation=process`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-containers/hyperv-container):

```pwsh
docker run -it --rm --isolation=process -v .:C:/skyrim-community-shaders skyrim-community-shaders:latest
```
